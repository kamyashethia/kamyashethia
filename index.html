<h1>Stay tuned for an exciting makeover</h1>
  <p> 
    But why redo the site? And why leave this ugly screen! And why not leave the old site up until said maintenance is complete? 
    
    I had the site the way it was for nearly a year, and I realized it didn't really reflect my current developer personality.
    It felt like the website of a recent college grad, and I have some fun ideas I want to share now :) 
    The ugly screen, and removing the old site is here to give me a push to design and visualize things a little faster. 
    
    It should be fun. :) 
    
    In all seriousness, I've set myself a completely arbitrary deadline of Sept 27, 2018 and COME BACK THEN :D
